Hi exercism-bot,

Since the beginning, we've been longing to get to a point where we can hire a full-time team to unleash Exercism's potential. 
After the launch and success of the new platform at the end of last year, and generous support from our community and supporting organisations, we're finally there. 
We couldn't be more excited! ü•≥

In expanding the team and growing Exercism, we have three main goals:

- Firstly, we want to do more of what we've got right already - providing a fun way for developers to improve their skills and learn new languages. 
  We have a whole load of new content planned, expanding from programming languages to wider programming expertise. 
  Expect deeper content on programming concepts and practical skills such as refactoring and application design.
- Secondly, we‚Äôre going to be building out a full ‚ÄúLearn to Code‚Äù part of the platform aimed at total beginners, designed using Exercism‚Äôs ‚Äúlearn by doing‚Äù method. We believe that everyone should be able to learn to code, entirely for free, and we‚Äôre going to build an amazing platform to facilitate that.

- Finally, we want to expand the community aspects of Exercism. 
  Community is at the heart of Exercism, in our content, our mentoring, and our sharing of knowledge. 
  We're only just scraping the surface of how our community can support each other and have loads of ideas about how to deepen the role everyone can play in supporting and learning from each other.

We're hiring for four roles:

- Community Manager - to help design and lead our community strategy.
- Content Factotum - to support our maintainers and write exercises and educational content for Exercism.
- React/CSS Dev - to lead on the front-end development of Exercism.
- Ruby on Rails Dev - to develop our Rails backend and Ruby microservices.

I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to the thousands of you that have contributed and donated to Exercism to make this possible. 
Together, we're creating an incredible platform that teaches programming education to the highest of standards, and giving it to the world for free.

Kind regards,
Jeremy Walker, 
CEO of Exercism
